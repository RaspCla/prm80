This firmware intended to be use with PRM8060 and PRM8070 radios.
Visit our home page for more informations: http://prm80.sourceforge.net

Updating the firmware :
-----------------------
Burn an EPROM from a binary file (.hex or .bin)
You can also build the firmware from source code (see below)


To build from the source code :
-------------------------------
Source code is originaly compiled with ASEM 51 (http://plit.de/asem-51/)
Check if asem51 is correctly installed and binaries are in the system path.

Under Linux :
	just type "make" to build the source
    
Under Windows / Dos
      Make sure asem51 binaries are in the system path, if not, you can also copy 
      asem.exe, hexbin.exe and 83c552.mcu in the "src" directory ; beware of the 
      length of files & directories names ("8.3" DOS names must be used ; the root 
      of the drive would be a good choice as the main directory).
      Run "build.bat"

To build it manualy (Without make or build.bat)
	Don't forget to add the TARGET constant in the command line.
        i.e : "asem -d TARGET:8060 prm.a51"
