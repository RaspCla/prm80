Introduction
============
The PRM8060 is a truncking radio. 

This device use the same radio and cpu board as the [PRM8070](PRM8070.md). The front board is composed of a 2 digits LCD, a volume control potentiometer and only 4 push buttons.

Squelch and Volume
==================
The keys up and down keys allow mainly to change the channel. A long pressure for fast mode.

Switching to squelch level is done by a short push on the squelch button (Middle left). Another press of this key, return to channel mode. The squelch mode is indicated by a flag on the LCD
The squelch level can be changed throught the up and down keys (Same as channel) from 0 to 15.

Setting the volume is done through the potentiometer, turning the device on by a pressure on
the latter.

Scanning
========
Channel scanning can be started by pressing two seconds the squelch key (center left). When the squelch is open, the scanning is holded until the squelch is not closed again. To stop the scanner, the scan button should be pushed again. Pressing the PTT also stop channel scanning. Any channel can be locked out of scanning when programming (see [Computer control](Computer_control.md) )

Working on repeaters
====================
When the arrow is present on the right hand corner of the screen, the selected channel is configurated with a TX frequency different from the RX one (i.e. the negative 600kHz on VHF).
The dial on the right of the LCD screen allows to activate the reverse function, that is to inverse the frequency of transmission and reception: a star appears when the transciever works in reverse mode. If the modification has been done, a 1750 Hz can be transmitted by pushing simultaneously on the PTT button and on the command button of the 1750 Hz of the microphone. It is also possible to activate the tonality by pressing the reverse button of the front end, while the radio is transmitting (PTT pushed).

Reset
=====
Resetting can be achieved if necessary, the factory parameters of the transciever are back in function. This function is automatically done when the new eprom is put into use. To manually force the zero setting, you have to press simultaneously the up and down keys when the transciever is connected again to the power, during this procedure there is a signal coming out of the loudspeaker.

RSSI indicator
==============
In the way to tune the reception elements of the PRM8060, you can display the level of the received signals. The « Squelch » and « reverse » buttons must be pressed at the same time. The given value is in hexadecimal format. To go back in the normal mode, press again the two keys.
